    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make the patties: Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk,
        1/2 packet onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper
        together in a large bowl; shape into 5 patties.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet
        until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Make the gravy: Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high
        heat. Saut√© mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5
        minutes. Stir flour and remaining 1/2 packet onion soup mix into
        mushroom mixture until combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add beef stock and water, stirring continually, until
        simmering. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring frequently, until gravy
        has thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place browned patties into gravy; simmer until very tender, about 30
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
        read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
